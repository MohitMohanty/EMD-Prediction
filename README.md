Data Prediction : Estimated Man Days with Python

    Data Preparation:
        Loaded an Excel dataset using pandas.
        Filled missing values in the dataset.

    Model Training:
        Used RandomForestRegressor for predicting the "EMD" column based on text and categorical features.
        Utilized CountVectorizer for text feature transformation.
        Built a Dash web application for prediction.

    Dash App Layout:
        Designed a user interface with input fields and dropdowns for user input.
        Structured the layout using HTML Divs and Tables.
        Styled the layout for better alignment.

    Graphical Visualization:
        Created a histogram and a scatter plot using Plotly.
        Implemented a callback to update the graph based on user inputs.
        Initialized the graph with the initial point at (0, 0).

    Layout Alignment and Styling:
        Adjusted the layout to make it visually appealing.
        Set left margin for the table data.

    Future Consideration:
        Provided instructions to make further modifications, such as changing the initial point of the graph.
